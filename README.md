Greetings to the Uber Eats service!

This is a food delivery service from restaurants, as well as takeaway food. The frontend is written in pure HTML and CSS, with the exception of a small script for the "language" drop-down list.

The site is fully adaptive and has been tested on resolutions from 300 to 1400px, as well as directly on a smartphone. 

This project is written as a business card. This means that when you click on a restaurant, you go to a single page of the restaurant. 

All animations are also written in CSS, which lightens the weight of the site. 

Write all suggestions and suggestions in issues! I will be glad to receive feedback!
